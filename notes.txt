Django: High level python web framework that encourages rapid 
        development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced 
        developers, it takes care of the hassle of web development, so 
        you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent 
        the wheel.

What can Django do?
    -Minimize coding time.
    -You'll be able to access a built-in admin interface as soon as 
     you implement a model (database).
    -You'll be released form SQL coding. You can still use it, but it
     is not needed.

Why Python/Django?
    -ridiculously fast
    -fully loaded
    -Reassuringly secure
    -Exceedingly scalable
    -Incredibly versatile
